# vlc-subtitles-sync

VLC extension to easily synchronize subtitles to media, using "catch" and "release". <br>

### installation
* Windows: copy **SubSync.lua** to:  ...\VideoLAN\VLC\\**lua\extensions** , and 
* Linux: (xubuntu) copy **SubSync.lua** to: ~snap/vlc/365/.local/share/vlc/lua/extensions/ (create subfolders if not present)

(re)start VLC. That's it. <br>

### usage
View -> SubSync to open.<br>
First, load media (movie, song ...) and subtitles (you can use VLsub addon for that), then, <br>
**Catch** a subtitle line, by clicking the 'Catch' button when the line appears, and <br>
**Release** the line at the correct time. <br>

Tested on Windows and Linux (xubuntu 18.04.1) using VLC version 3.0.3
