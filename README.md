# vlc-subtitles-sync

Easily synchronize the subtitles to the media, using "catch" and "release".
First, load media (movie, song ...) and subtitles (you can use VLsub addon for that), then,
Catch a subtitle line, by clicking the 'Catch' button when the line appears, and
Release the line at the correct time.
